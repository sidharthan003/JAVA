JAVA - Complete DSA Programs

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Java. It includes fundamental data structures, algorithms, and practice programs, designed to help learners understand and implement key DSA concepts.



üåü Features & Implementations

1Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays

Basic and multi-dimensional arrays

Array operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)

Solving common array problems

2Ô∏è‚É£ Linked Lists

Singly and doubly linked lists

Insert, delete, search, and display operations

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stacks

Implementation using arrays and linked lists

Push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations

Useful for expression evaluation and recursion practice

4Ô∏è‚É£ Queues

Implementation using arrays and linked lists

Enqueue, dequeue, peek operations

Level order traversal in trees uses queue internally

5Ô∏è‚É£ Trees

Binary Tree

Manual node insertion

Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order

Optional hierarchy visualization

Binary Search Tree (BST)

Automatic insertion maintaining BST property

Search and delete nodes (handles 0, 1, or 2 children)

Traversals: Inorder (sorted), Preorder, Postorder, Level Order

Tested in BSTMain.java
